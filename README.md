# BDD21
Readily estimate incompatible-element concentrations within both solid and liquid phases along a melting path, with seamless integration into your geodynamic workflow.

BDD21 is made of three different Python scripts (found in the `src` directory):
- `ChemistryData.py`, which contains information about investigated chemical elements, such as their valency, effective ionic radii ([Shannon, 1976](https://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/paper?a12967)) and reference partition coefficients ([McKenzie and O'Nions, 1995](https://academic.oup.com/petrology/article-abstract/36/1/133/1433534)). It also provides an estimated composition of the Depleted MORB Mantle (DMM; [Salters and Stracke, 2004](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2003GC000597)) and of the Primitive Mantle (PM; [McKenzie and O'Nions, 1995](https://academic.oup.com/petrology/article-abstract/36/1/133/1433534));
- `Melt.py`, which is an implementation of the hydrous mantle melting parameterisation of [Katz, Spiegelman and Langmuir (2003)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2002GC000433) coupled to the thermodynamic framework of [McKenzie (1984)](https://academic.oup.com/petrology/article-abstract/25/3/713/1394279);
- `MeltChemistry.py`, which calculates element concentrations within both melt and residue along a melting path by solving for the governing equations <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\bg_white&space;\large&space;{\color{Golden}&space;\frac{dc_{s}}{dX}&space;=&space;\frac{c_{s}&space;-&space;c_{l}}{1&space;-&space;X}}" title="\large {\color{Golden} \frac{dc_{s}}{dX} = \frac{c_{s} - c_{l}}{1 - X}}" /> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\bg_white&space;\large&space;{\color{Golden}c_{l}&space;=&space;\frac{c_{s}(1&space;-&space;X)}{\bar{D}&space;-&space;\bar{P}X}}" title="\large {\color{Purple}c_{l} = \frac{c_{s}(1 - X)}{\bar{D} - \bar{P}X}}" /> ([White, McKenzie and O'Nions, 1992](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/92JB01749)).

Example simplified model outputs generated through [Fluidity](https://github.com/FluidityProject/fluidity) can be found in the `examples` directory.
