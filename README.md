# BDD21
Readily estimate incompatible-element concentrations within both solid and liquid phases along a melting path, with seamless integration into your geodynamic workflow.

BDD21 is a collection of Python scripts (found in the sub-directory of your choice in the `src` directory):
- `ChemistryData.py`, which contains necessary parameters that characterise probed chemical elements, such as their valency, effective ionic radii ([Shannon, 1976](https://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/paper?a12967)) and reference partition coefficients ([McKenzie and O'Nions, 1995](https://academic.oup.com/petrology/article-abstract/36/1/133/1433534)). It also provides an estimated composition of the Depleted MORB Mantle (DMM; [Salters and Stracke, 2004](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2003GC000597)) and of the Primitive Mantle (PM; [McKenzie and O'Nions, 1995](https://academic.oup.com/petrology/article-abstract/36/1/133/1433534));
- `Melt.py`, which is an implementation of the hydrous mantle melting parameterisation of [Katz, Spiegelman and Langmuir (2003)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2002GC000433) coupled to the thermodynamic framework of [McKenzie (1984)](https://academic.oup.com/petrology/article-abstract/25/3/713/1394279);
- `MeltChemistryFunctions.py`, which contains the main integrator function that returns element concentrations within both melt and residue along a melting path by solving the governing equations <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\bg_white&space;\large&space;{\color{Golden}&space;\frac{dc_{s}}{dX}&space;=&space;\frac{c_{s}&space;-&space;c_{l}}{1&space;-&space;X}}" title="\large {\color{Golden} \frac{dc_{s}}{dX} = \frac{c_{s} - c_{l}}{1 - X}}" /> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\bg_white&space;\large&space;{\color{Golden}c_{l}&space;=&space;\frac{c_{s}(1&space;-&space;X)}{\bar{D}&space;-&space;\bar{P}X}}" title="\large {\color{Purple}c_{l} = \frac{c_{s}(1 - X)}{\bar{D} - \bar{P}X}}" /> ([White, McKenzie and O'Nions, 1992](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/92JB01749)).
- `MeltChemistryH5.py`, which demonstrates how to use the framework in a post-processing manner using particle attributes stored in HDF5 format and provides a function to generate the mineralogy and chemistry along a 1-D adiabatic melting path.
- `MeltChemistryNumba.py`, which contains the core functions of the BDD21 framework that calculate the mineralogy and partition coefficients at given melt fraction, pressure and temperature.

Example model outputs generated through [Fluidity](https://github.com/FluidityProject/fluidity) can be found in the `examples` directory. FLML files contain Python functions that demonstrate the use of BDD21 while the geodynamic simulation runs.

Contributions to the framework are highly encouraged; the current code architecture is sufficiently modular to accommodate both targeted and global improvements.

**Note**: If you make use of the dense output capability of LSODA through SciPy, be aware that the interpolation scheme is incorrect and can lead to inaccuracies. It is recommended you apply the proposed changes included in this [SciPy PR](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/pull/14552).
